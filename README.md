# My GitHub Blog

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have the following:

    - Ruby Bundler
    - Ruby Integration
    - Ruby Devel
    - G++
    - GNU Make
    - Zlib

2. Run the `./serve` script

3. (Optional) call `bundle update` to bump up Gem versions.

4. Browse to <http://localhost:4000>

## Contents

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site compatible with GitHub
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
  as a remote theme (non-forked)
- `_posts/template.md` for the usual Front-matter.
- `_includes/head/custom.html` for favicon integration.

## Notes

- I use `/assets/images` to store small images (less than 100KB).
  Large images must be hosted elsewhere.
- I use [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to assist me with written English (BrE).
- I use [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/features/collage-maker/) to make collages
  that aren't just square (a limitation of Google Photos).
- I used [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) for seamless compatibility
  with desktop and mobile browsers.
