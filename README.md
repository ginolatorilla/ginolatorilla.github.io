# My GitHub blog

## Quickstart

1. Make sure you have the following:

    - Ruby Bundler
    - Ruby Integration
    - Ruby Devel
    - G++
    - GNU Make
    - Zlib

2. Run the `./serve` script

3. Browse to <http://localhost:4000>

## Contents

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site compatible with GitHub
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) as a remote theme (non-forked)
- Inkscape SVG sources for imagery in `src`.
- `_posts/template.md` for the usual Front-matter.
- `_includes/head/custom.html` for favicon.

## Notes

- I use `/assets/images` to store small images (less than 100KB), and use [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) for large and high-quality.
- I've set aside a shared album and map the long image URLs in `_data/from_google_photos.yaml`.
- I nominated three categories for my posts: **software**, **sports**, and **travel**.
- I use [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to assist me with written English (BrE).
- I use [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/features/collage-maker/) to make collages that aren't just square (a limitation of Google Photos).
- I used [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) for seamless compatibility with desktop and mobile browsers.
