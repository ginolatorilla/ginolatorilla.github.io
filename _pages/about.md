I'm **Gino Latorilla** and welcome to my blog, where I write about software and tech.

I am a Technical Leader for radio software, where I make apps build faster and run leaner.

In 2011 I joined [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/). I was still a student at [UP Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/)
and finishing my Bachelor's Degree. I progressed from a junior engineer to a software architect.
Asides from coding, I've coached several of my colleagues. I've been in the company for 9 years.

I love solving problems with code. If I'm not busy, then I'm learning new things,
trying to make my house smarter, or writing (hopefully) interesting stuff.

I like riding bikes. If you see someone wearing a Nokia Cycling Jersey here in the Philippines,
then the designer is *yours truly*.

**Thanks for stopping by, and happy reading!**
