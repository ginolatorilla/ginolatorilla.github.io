I am Gino Latorilla and I'm a Technical Leader in Nokia.

![A collage about me]({{ site.data.from_google_photos.about_collage }})

I'm a DevOps practitioner (uncertified, yet). I code with C++, Python, and JavaScript. I'm also a resident instructor where I teach my peers all about software engineering. I maintain an instructional site with articles and screencasts.

When I'm not coding, I sweat it out. I started as a runner, racing 10Ks and half marys. Then I bought a bike and raced duathlons and eventually triathlons. I hope someday to finish an Ironman.

I travel all around our beautiful islands with my beautiful girlfriend. We have a lot of pristine beaches and breathtaking mountains here in the Philippines.

**Thanks for stopping by, and happy reading!**
